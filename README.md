## Notes

# 1. `Why does a user remain signed in after a page reload even if the Redux store value is removed?`

Answer:
ðŸ‘‰ Firebase persists the user session in `local storage` by default. So even if you remove the user from Redux, on page reload Firebase still considers the user signed in. If the Redux store is not synced with Firebaseâ€™s auth state, Redux starts empty and the UI may behave incorrectly.

`Fixing this issue:` Using the Firebase `signOut api` it get solved.

# 2. `What getAuth() does?`

    When you use:
    ```
    import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
    export const auth = getAuth();
    ```

ðŸ‘‰ getAuth() creates (or fetches) an authentication instance that is linked to your Firebase app.
This auth object is like your gateway to all Firebase Authentication features â€” sign-in, sign-out, user info, managing sessions, etc.

ðŸ‘‰`In Short`: export const auth = getAuth(); gives you one authentication instance connected to your Firebase project. You then pass it into functions like signInWithEmailAndPassword, signOut, etc., to control all authentication-related features in your app.
